# Item Frequency Counter Program
     Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program allows a store to be able to view the frequency of items sold throughout the day.

A menu inputs a choice 1-4 from the user: 

 - Option 1 will input an item from the user, and will then output that item's frequency sold throughout the day. 

 - Option 2 will output the whole list of items along with their frequencies. 

 - Option 3 will do the same but in histogram form using ‘*’s instead of numbers for visual representation. 

 - Option 4 will then terminate the program. 

This program analyzes daily text records from input file CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt: 

The records consist of a list of purchased items in order from the stores open to the stores close. 

A data file frequency.dat is created at the beginning of the program without user intervention and is for writing purposes. 

The frequency.dat file will include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of times that item appears in the input file.



     What did you do particularly well?

 - I did well in the area of perseverance. Every time that I got stuck, I was able to think of or find some way to go about fixing my problem. 

 - I did pretty well at shortening my main, even though It could’ve been shortened even more. 

 - I also did a good job of staying true to the pseudocode and updating it as needed. 



     Most challenging parts?

Reading, writing, and manipulating files along with using classes are all things I could use more practice on. 

As such, I found these areas most challenging but also the most fun to mess with. 



     What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?

There are numerous skills from this project that are transferable to my future projects. These would include:

 - Writing proper, well written code

 - Manipulating, reading, and writing to files

 - Creating and using classes

 - Do-while loops and switch cases

 - Modularizing code and incremental writing
   




       How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
     
I tried to cut down on the length of my main to make my code more readable. This also makes it more maintainable for future adaptations and additions. 

For improvement, my main could be further cut down and made to look cleaner.
